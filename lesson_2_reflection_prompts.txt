What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I got massage:
Initialized existing Git repository in /Users/hujie/Desktop/CurrentLearning/udacityProgram/P_2_version_control/repo_test/.git/

This create the hidden folder ‘.git’ and initialise for git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

there’s a ‘.git’ folder, I believe it includes history of my commitments

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

If I want to modify code based on an older version, branch will help me to avoid affect other versions which might be used for other purposes.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The branch is like a tree diagram and I can easily understand how different commits going under different branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do? 
Not sure.
I think we should know to keep which branch.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
